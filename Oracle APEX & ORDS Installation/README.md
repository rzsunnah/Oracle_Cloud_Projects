# Oracle APEX & ORDS Installation

--
I've successfully installed and configured Oracle APEX (Application Express) and Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS) to enable rapid application development and web service integration on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). The goal was to create a development environment for building modern web applications that interact with the Oracle Database and can be accessed through RESTful APIs. Also I have done with the web version like Tomcat.

‚úÖ Configured SSL certificates for secure access to the web applications and APIs.

üîπ Installation Process

1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites and Planning

  -- Oracle Database:
  --
  Ensured that an Oracle Database instance is running on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).

  -- OCI Compute Instance: Provisioned an OCI Compute instance (VM) that will host the ORDS and APEX configuration.

  -- Web Server: Installed Apache HTTP Server or Oracle HTTP Server (OHS) to handle incoming web requests for Oracle APEX and ORDS.
  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Installing Oracle APEX
Downloaded the latest version of Oracle APEX from the official Oracle website.
Unzipped the installation files on the OCI Compute instance.
Logged into SQL*Plus as SYSDBA user and ran the APEX installation script to install APEX into the Oracle Database.
Configured HTTP listener for APEX using Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS).
Enabled and configured the APEX Instance Administration schema for managing applications.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Installing Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS)
Downloaded the latest version of Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS) from Oracle‚Äôs website.
Installed ORDS on the OCI Compute instance.
Configured the web listener for ORDS (e.g., Apache HTTP Server or Oracle HTTP Server).
Configured Oracle Database connection details in ORDS to link it to the Oracle Database.
Enabled RESTful web services on the Oracle Database to expose database objects (tables, views, procedures) as REST APIs.
Configured ORDS for handling application development and serving RESTful APIs created in APEX.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Configuring Oracle APEX & ORDS
Enabled APEX administration using the APEX administration URL and configured user access, workspace creation, and database connections.
Created a few sample applications in APEX to test the functionality.
Set up security protocols such as enabling SSL for encrypted connections between clients and the APEX/ORDS server.
Configured user authentication for accessing APEX applications and RESTful APIs.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Deploying APEX Applications
Created web-based applications in APEX using the provided wizards.
Deployed applications on the OCI-based APEX instance, making them accessible from anywhere.
Configured user access and roles for multi-user application development environments.
Tested APEX applications through browsers to ensure they were working as expected.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Exposing RESTful Web Services
Defined and published RESTful web services in APEX using the ORDS framework.
Enabled Oracle Database objects like tables, views, and PL/SQL stored procedures to be accessed via REST APIs.
Tested API endpoints using Postman or curl commands to ensure they worked as expected.
