# Oracle APEX & ORDS Installation

**I've successfully installed and configured Oracle APEX (Application Express) and Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS) to enable rapid application development and web service integration on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). The goal was to create a development environment for building modern web applications that interact with the Oracle Database and can be accessed through RESTful APIs. Also I have done with the web version like Tomcat.**

‚úÖ Installed and configured Oracle APEX and Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS) with different versions.

‚úÖ Integrated Oracle APEX with Oracle Cloud Databases for seamless application hosting and management.

‚úÖ Configured SSL certificates for secure access to the web applications and APIs.
