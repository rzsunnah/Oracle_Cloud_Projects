# This project involves migrating Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS 12.2) from on-premises to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) using the Lift and Shift approach. The migration helped improve scalability, performance, and disaster recovery while minimizing downtime.

üîπ Key Achievements
‚úÖ Successfully migrated EBS 12.2 from on-premises to OCI.
‚úÖ Configured OCI Compute, Block Storage, and Networking for EBS deployment.
‚úÖ Optimized database performance and applied necessary patches.
‚úÖ Ensured minimal downtime during migration and post-migration validation.

üîπ Migration Steps
1Ô∏è‚É£ Pre-Migration Assessment & Planning
   -- Evaluated existing EBS infrastructure, storage, and performance metrics.
   -- Planned downtime, compatibility checks, and rollback strategy.
   -- Identified patch requirements for OCI compatibility.
2Ô∏è‚É£ OCI Infrastructure Setup
   -- Created OCI Compute instances for EBS Application and Database tiers.
   -- Configured Virtual Cloud Network (VCN), subnets, security lists.
   -- Attached Block Volumes to OCI instances for storage optimization.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Database Migration
   -- Used RMAN backup & restore method for data migration.
   -- Configured Oracle Data Guard for replication and failover.
   -- Applied patches and post-migration configurations.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Application Tier Migration
   -- Copied EBS application files to OCI Compute instances.
   -- Reconfigured hostname, concurrent managers, and network settings.
   -- Performed end-to-end functional validation.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Post-Migration Validation & Performance Tuning
   -- Conducted load testing and performance optimization.
   -- Verified workflow integrations, concurrent processing, and reporting.
   -- Ensured compliance with security and backup policies.
