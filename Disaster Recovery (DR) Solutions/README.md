# Disaster Recovery (DR) Solutions

**In this project, I designed and implemented a Disaster Recovery (DR) Solution using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) for several customers to ensure business continuity and high availability for mission-critical applications and data. The solution leverages automated backups, data replication, and failover strategies to recover from any potential disruptions, minimizing downtime and data loss.**

üîπ **Key Achievements**

‚úÖ Successfully implemented DR for mission-critical workloads.

‚úÖ Configured OCI Block Volumes, Object Storage, and File Storage for backups.

‚úÖ Integrated Oracle Data Guard for database replication and failover(different for version).

‚úÖ Set up automated backups for both application and database layers(scripted and scheduled in cronjob).

‚úÖ Designed and validated DR failover procedures to ensure minimal downtime.

‚úÖ Achieved business continuity with geographically distributed DR sites.

üîπ **Implementation Details**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Assessment & Planning**

	-- Evaluated business requirements and identified critical applications, databases, and infrastructure components to be included in the DR plan.
 
	-- Designed a disaster recovery architecture that aligns with OCI best practices and supports high availability.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Backup Strategy Configuration**

	-- Configured OCI Block Volumes for database and application backups.
 
	-- Implemented Oracle RMAN for automated database backups and cross-region replication.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Replication & Database Failover**

	-- Set up Oracle Data Guard for real-time database replication across multiple OCI regions.
 
	-- Configured synchronous and asynchronous replication to ensure data consistency across sites.
 
	-- Tested automatic failover scenarios to validate high availability during a disaster.
 
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Failover Testing & Recovery Validation**

	-- Conducted regular DR failover drills to validate the recovery process and response times.
 
	-- Ensured the seamless failover of applications to the secondary site without service interruptions.
 
	-- Created manual with detailed instructions on how to trigger failover and failback operations.
